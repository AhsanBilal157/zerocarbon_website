                                <p className="About-detail">Organica began with a vision to transform agriculture by making it more sustainable and inclusive. Our founders recognized the potential of women in rural farming communities and the urgent need for greener agricultural practices. By combining these two powerful forces, Organica was born, a movement dedicated to regenerative agriculture, empowering women farmers, and digitalizing green farming. Today, we stand at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, bringing the best of both worlds to the farming industry.</p>
